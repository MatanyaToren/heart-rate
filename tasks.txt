To Do:
1. move roi finder to tracking module so bbox and roi would be synchronized
2. add more rois in both cheaks and forehaed
3. compute snr
4. maybe check out if POS (Plane Orthogonal to Skin) method works
5. smooth estimation of heart rate and respiratory rate using maybe kalman filter

later:
6. find paper with clear comparison method and suiting databse
7. implement script to evaluate our method
